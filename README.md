# To Do List With Unsolicited Advice

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to start:

- Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the app in development mode. It will automatically open.
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## How to build the app:

Run `yarn build` or `npm run build`. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### About the app
The main constrain was time (3 hours). My main goal was getting an MVP with clean code, some tests and clear documentation that works. So I choose to use technologies I'm comfortable with and that are less time consuming.

### How I started with the assignment
1) I first read the assignment completely to check if I understand it and if I have questions (best to ask them at this stage). 
2) As I'm working with an API, I tested it to see if it does what I expect and what endpoints and filters are available. 
3) I choose what my goal will be and I decided that I want to first have a list of all the launches with error and loading. Then I could add at least one filter to the list. I reasearch a few minutes about react-simple-maps and google-map-react but as it's my first time using maps I don't want to lose time with that.
4) Before coding, I also think a little about the components I'm building and what I want them to do. I put a HTML base with header, footer, main etc

### Decisions about setup, library and techniques
1) This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with `React` and `Typescript`. I choose it because it's a well known library with good documentation I feel confortable with.  There are other newer options like `Vite` that could have also work.
2) `Styled components` as the  styling framework
3) `Jest` and `React testing library` for testing.
4) `Hooks` for state management

### What I would have change if I have more time, why and how.
1) Testing: I started with testing and documentation a bit late for my taste.
